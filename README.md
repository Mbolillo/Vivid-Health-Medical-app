Vivid Health Dublin is an application that connects patients and doctors to allow online appointments, remote consultation, electronic prescription transfer, and payment services.

App was built in AWS C9 IDE and Ruby on rails has been selected as the ideal framework to design it. Admin, doctors and patients have different views and access depending on their user permission.

In order to run the application successfully it is needed to run the following commands on the AWS Cloud 9 IDE:

1) echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
2) gem install rails -v 5.2.3
3) sudo yum install ImageMagick (This will allow doctors to upload prescriptions images for patients).
4) Paste the “Health” app file inside the environment.
5) Bundle install with the app
